<p>You will have to call us during office hours for the cancellation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Do i have to register in order to schedule an appointment with you?</span></p>
<p>Yes, but you will not need to create a password for your account. It will be stored in our database along with your phone number and address for our use only. No one else will see it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Will my information be secure with you?</span></p>
<p>Yes, your information will be secure. We also would not ask you to provide any sensitive personal information, so there is no need to worry about it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Due to the current situation with the pandemic, will I be able to schedule an online consultation with you?</span></p>
<p>Yes. You will need to specify in the special consideration textbox that you wish for the meeting to occur online. We will send you further information concerning the consultation via your email or by calling you.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">5. How long in advance should I schedule an appointment with your store?</span></p>
<p>You may schedule appointments within our office hours one hour in advance except for vaccine injection services, which requires 24 hours for us to prepare for. Our scheduling system will make sure that you do not violate these rules, so as long as you follow the available time slots, you will have nothing to worry about.</p>
